Welcome to Cretaceous Park

It looks like something is wrong at Cretaceous Park.  The power went out at
all of the facilities housing the dinosaurs! We need your help to go through the code,
figure out what went wrong, and fix it before we are all eaten by hungry dinos.  

You should use Visual Studio to solve this problem.
When the park is up and running correctly it should say 'Cretacous Park is successfully up and running' in the console.
Do not edit the program file or any file with the word constants in it.  

Feel free to reach out to Troy Rubenstein if you have any questions or issues.

    1. Make sure that you have Git installed on your machine
